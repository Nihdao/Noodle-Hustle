# Game Description ‚Äì Noodle Balance

## üéØ Pitch

You play as a former office worker who quits their job to pursue a new life running artisanal noodle stands. Faced with debt, employee management, social pressure, and personal burnout, the protagonist must build a thriving business while maintaining a healthy mental balance. The game combines passive simulation, light management mechanics, social interactions, and stylized arcade moments.

## üß† Core Concept
- Manage multiple noodle stands and employees.
- Balance personal well-being and economic growth.
- Build social relationships to unlock passive buffs.
- Navigate random events and critical reviews.
- Confront your investor every 10 periods through a debate-battle.


## üéÆ Core Gameplay Loop

### Hub Interface (per Period)
- **Noodle Bars**: Overview of active stands (revenue, staff, condition, rating).
- **Employees**: Hire, assign, train, and monitor staff morale.
- **Debts**: Track borrowed funds, pay back loans, refinance if needed.
- **Social**: Interact with 5 key NPCs to develop bonds and unlock bonuses.
- **Start Period**: Launches the delivery simulation and resolves all stand activities.

## ü•á Progression and Endgame
- **Ultimate Goal**: Become the Top 1 ranked artisan noodle chain in the region.
- **Game Over Conditions**:
  - Total burnout (mental gauge full).
  - Bankruptcy (unrecoverable negative balance).
- **Restart System**: Player can continue from 10 periods prior to failure.
- **No narrative ending** ‚Äì continued play is allowed post-victory.

## üìä Business Rank Structure (TBD Labels)
- Rank 101+: Street Noodle Stand
- Rank 61‚Äì100: Newcomer
- Rank 31‚Äì60: Promising Business
- Rank 11‚Äì30: Good Reputation
- Rank 2‚Äì10: Recognized Artisan
- Rank 1: Legendary Noodle Shop

Based on customer satisfaction, total profit, stand diversity, and growth rate.

## üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Burnout System
- One mental gauge tracking burnout (no "stress" on the other end).
- Burnout increases with:
  - Overwork
  - Negative events
  - Low staff morale
- Reduced by:
  - Rest periods
  - Positive social interactions
  - Stand success and morale boosts

## ü§ù Social System
- 5 characters with individual storylines.
- Each relationship has 5 levels.
- Levels unlock passive business or mental bonuses:
  - Reduce burnout
  - Increase profit margins
  - Improve employee morale
  - Discover secret recipes
  - Boost special event success

## üöö Delivery Simulation (Passive Side-Scroller)
- Each stand is visualized as a horizontal track.
- Player‚Äôs character rides a scooter collecting results.
- Animated bubbles pop up:
  - "Delivery Success"
  - "Client Loved It!"
  - "Kitchen Mishap"
  - "Recipe Bonus"
- Unfolds automatically.
- At end of delivery:
  - Each stand gets a bowl icon:
    - Full Bowl = Perfect
    - Tilted Bowl = Decent
    - Spilled Bowl = Failure

Random events occur during periods:
- Good events (free PR, customer gifts).
- Problems (stockouts, sick staff).
- Some resolved instantly, others involve a risk/reward decision (dice roll %).

## üí¨ Investor Debate (Every 10 Periods)

Simplified battle system inspired by Yakuza:
- Bring 4 employees with elemental roles:
  - Red = Authority
  - Green = Empathy
  - Blue = Data
- Enemy investor attacks with elements.
- Match correct employee (rock-paper-scissors dynamic):
  - Red > Green
  - Green > Blue
  - Blue > Red

Cooldowns apply between employee uses.

Success or failure affected by:
- Business results from last periods
- Employee morale
- Social link bonuses

Winning the debate grants:
- Reduced interest rates
- Public recognition
- Bonus opportunities

Losing results in:
- Tighter loan conditions
- Possible penalty events

## üé® Visual and Technical Style
- **Art**: Pixel art, urban Asian street-food aesthetic.
- **UI**: Built using **React** for all menu/hub/social elements with **TailwindCSS 4.1**.
- **Game engine**: **Phaser 3** used for side-scroller and animations.
- **Responsive**: Designed for both desktop and mobile (touch-friendly).

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Replayability and Flow
- No forced ending.
- Once Top 1 is reached, players can continue expanding freely.
- Failure allows retry from previous period checkpoints.
- New playthroughs may include shuffled staff/recipes/events for variety.
