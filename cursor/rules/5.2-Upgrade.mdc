# 5.2 – Upgrade Noodle Bars

## 🎯 Purpose

Allows the player to **invest in their active noodle bars** to increase their potential for revenue, product quality, and reputation. Each upgrade boosts performance ceilings but also demands better staff assignments to maintain effectiveness.

---

## 🧭 Access

From the **Noodle Bars** screen, clicking the **Upgrade** button opens a management interface:

- **Left Panel**: list of all currently owned and active noodle bars
- **Right Panel**: detailed view of the selected bar with its current team, visuals, and upgrade options

---

## 🛠️ Upgrade Categories

Each noodle bar has upgradable domains:

1. **💴 Sales Volume**  
   - Increases potential revenue per period  
   - Unlocks higher client flow and demand

2. **🍱 Product (Cuisine)**  
   - Impacts food quality performance  
   - If unmet by staff stats, may result in client dissatisfaction

3. **💖 Service**  
   - Impacts waiting times and customer service quality  
   - If unmet, leads to lower satisfaction and event penalties

4. **🎭 Notability (Ambiance)**  
   - Boosts visibility and client diversity (VIPs)  
   - Low ambiance = less client attraction and poorer review spread

---

## 💰 Cost and Scaling

- Each domain can be upgraded **from level 1 to a cap**, depending on the potential of the property
- The cost **in dollars ($)** increases per level, progressively
- Example:  
  - Sales Volume Lv 4 → Lv 5: $1,200  
  - Product Lv 2 → Lv 3: $700

---

## ⚠️ Staff Requirement Logic

While there are **no direct bonuses** from Product, Service, or Notability levels:

> If the staff currently assigned **does not meet** the bar's level in any of these domains:  
> ❌ Negative effects apply during the delivery phase:
> - Increased risk of random negative events  
> - Lower revenue due to inefficiency  
> - Reduced review scores and overall satisfaction

---

## 🔄 UI Feedback

- Side-by-side display of:
  - Current level and next level
  - Cost in dollars
  - Confirm button
- Pixel art background may visually evolve based on upgrade levels (optional aesthetic)

---

## 💾 Persistence

Upgrades are **permanent and persistent** across all future periods.  
Players should think strategically about investing early vs allocating funds elsewhere.
