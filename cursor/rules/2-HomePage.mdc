# Home Page – Noodle Balance

## 🎮 Overview
The Home Page is the entry screen of the game. It contains the loading phase (preloader), followed by the main menu where players can start or continue their journey. It should be inviting, playful, and consistent with the noodle-themed aesthetic.

---

## ⏳ Preloader
- Uses Phaser’s default loading bar system (already integrated in the template).
- Displayed full screen until game assets are loaded.
- Visual style: simple and clean, with a light background.

---

## 🏠 Main Menu

### 🎨 Visual Design
- **Background**: pixel art illustration of the main noodle bar during daytime.
  - Blue sky, light clouds floating.
  - A few characters walking or interacting lightly (looped ambient animation).
- **Logo**: "Noodle Balance" in a hand-drawn noodle-style font (centered).

### 🧭 Menu Buttons
Displayed vertically under the title, centered on the screen:

1. **New Game**
   - Starts a brand new game.
   - Prompts for company name input.
   - Wipes previous save data.

2. **Continue** *(only visible if save data is found in localStorage)*
   - Resumes the game from the last saved period.

3. **Options**
   - Opens the same reusable modal as in the Hub screen.
   - Allows access to settings: audio, accessibility, language, etc.

4. **Credits**
   - Opens a separate page or modal listing:
     - Developers
     - Asset attributions (music, sprites, UI)
     - GameJam + sponsor credits

### 🕹️ Interaction
- Buttons are keyboard and touch compatible.
- Basic animation on hover (glow or bounce).
- Sound FX on click.

## 🧑‍💻 Technical Notes
- **React** handles the main menu and button logic.
- **Phaser** handles the preloader and animated background scene.
- Save state stored via **localStorage**.
