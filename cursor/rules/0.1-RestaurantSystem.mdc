# 0.1 ‚Äì Restaurant System & Properties

## üè¢ Core Restaurant Structure

Every restaurant (noodle bar) in the game is defined by a consistent set of attributes:

### üîç Base Attributes

-   **Name**: unique name for each noodle bar
-   **Description**: fun and flavorful one-liner
-   **Sell Price**: resale value in dollars (except for the first)
-   **Maintenance Cost**: recurring cost per period
-   **Staff Slots**: max of 3 employees per stand
-   **Labor Cost**: total wages of current assigned staff
-   **Sales Volume**: base estimated sales output

---

### üìä Performance Stats (with Potential Caps)

Each restaurant has its own maximum potential in four domains:

-   **üí¥ Sales Volume**
-   **üç± Product (Cuisine)**
-   **üíñ Service**
-   **üé≠ Ambiance (Notability)**

Stats range individually per property from 1 to 10.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The **first restaurant**, ‚ÄúNoodles Original‚Äù, has a perfect cap of **10 in every category** and is **unsellable**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Gameplay Implications

-   Higher potential restaurants are **more expensive to buy**
-   Each upgrade in a domain brings the bar closer to its potential cap
-   Strategic choice: do you invest in cheap early bars or save for high-cap monsters?
