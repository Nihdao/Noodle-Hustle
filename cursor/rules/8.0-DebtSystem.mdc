# 8.0 â€“ Debt System

This module allows the player to manage their outstanding debts and access new loans from their mysterious Business Angel.

## ðŸ§­ Access

From the Hub, clicking on **Debts** opens a dedicated screen with:
- Company name
- Current period
- Periods until next Business Angel meeting
- Profit forecast (updated dynamically)

---

## ðŸ’° Debt Management Panel

### Active Debt Summary
- List of current debts with:
  - Total borrowed
  - Remaining amount
  - Monthly repayment amount
  - Next payment date (in periods)
  - Interest rate

The player can view how much each loan impacts their **monthly budget** and overall cashflow.

### New Loan Offers

On the right side of the screen, the Business Angel may offer new loans.

#### Loan Proposal UI:
- Loan Amount options: e.g. $50,000 / $100,000 / $250,000 / $500,000
- Interest rate: randomized between 5% and 12%
- Repayment duration: fixed (e.g. 10 to 30 periods)

#### Player Options:
- Review conditions
- Accept the offer (adds to active debt)
- Decline the offer (no penalty)

New loans become available **after every Business Angel meeting**, or if funds fall below a critical threshold.

## ðŸ§¨ Debt Failure

- Failure to meet repayments for 3 consecutive periods = **Game Over (bankruptcy)**
- Repayments are automatic and deducted **at the start** of each period
- Player must balance loan usage with profitability to avoid financial collapse

The Debt screen is simple, elegant, and reflects the core balance mechanic: take risks to grow, but manage responsibly.
