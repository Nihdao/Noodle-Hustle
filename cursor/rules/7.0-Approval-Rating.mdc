# Approval Rating System

The **Approval Rating** is a central meta-resource in the game that reflects the trust and confidence the Business Angel and the broader market have in your noodle bar business. It impacts several gameplay mechanics and is closely tied to your progression through the corporate pyramid.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Approval Rating acts as a secondary resource that determines your **credibility** and **business viability**. Itâ€™s a required conditionâ€”alongside financial performanceâ€”for ascending the business pyramid.

## ðŸ“Š Role in Pyramid Progression

To advance up the pyramid, you must meet **two conditions**:
1. **Achieve your financial target** over the last 4 periods (e.g., profit, ROI, sales volume).
2. **Maintain an Approval Rating above a certain threshold** depending on the level.

| Pyramid Tier          | Required Approval Rating |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Sweatshop â†’ Micro      | > 40%                     |
| Micro â†’ Small Corp     | > 50%                     |
| Small â†’ Mid-Size Corp  | > 60%                     |
| Mid-Size â†’ Large Corp  | > 70%                     |
| Large â†’ Top Corp       | > 80%                     |

> Example: Even with great financials, if your Approval Rating is 45%, you wonâ€™t rise to the next tier until you fix that reputation.
